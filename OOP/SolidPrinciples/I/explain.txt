Interface Segregation Principle
Definition: a client shouldn't be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use.

It addresses the problem of designing large interfaces that force implementing classes to provide functionality they might not need.
The ISP encourages creating smaller, more specific interfaces that define only the methods relevant to the specific needs of the clients.
